> **Note: In this project, various technologies and tools such as Context API, Redux, axios, and fetch have been used to test and understand their differences. Some of these approaches may not align with current best practices, but my goal was to learn and experiment with these tools.**


I built an e-commerce platform similar to Digikala.com, focusing on speed and a cool look thanks to Next.js. To make shopping easy, I used Redux and RTK for the shopping cart, so everything stays organized. I added some neat slides for showing off products with Swiper, and for all the signup and login forms, I chose Formik to keep things straightforward and Yup for making sure the info is right. Plus, I made sure everything's secure and talking smoothly to the server with Swagger, keeping user logins safe.

## Features ðŸš€

- Login user with access token
- Signup user
- Shopping Cart with Redux Toolkit and persist
- Responsible slider with Swiper
- Custom carousel with React-Slick like exactly Digikala

## Tech Stack ðŸ’»

The following libraries and tools were utilized in the project:

- Next.js
- Redux, Redux-toolkit
- Formik, Yup
- React-slick and Swiper
- Axios
- React-Spinner
- React-icons

## Installation

To start this application, you need to have the data file of this program, which I will put in another repository. If you've never worked with Java, it might be hard at first to run the back-end on localhost, but I'll try my best to fully explain how to work with it.

### Before running the jar file

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java**: You need Java 17.0.2 to run the jar file. Download and install it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html).
- **MySQL Database**: This application requires a MySQL database.

### Install Java and run jar file

1. **Download the Jar File**: Download the latest version of the application jar file from the GitHub repository's Releases section.

2. **Prepare MySQL Database**:
   - Ensure your MySQL database is running.
   - Create a database for the application, if necessary.

3. **Configure Database Connection**:
   - You need to configure the database connection by setting your MySQL credentials in the `application.properties` file within the jar.
   - To access and modify the `application.properties` file, you can either extract the jar file using any standard archive tool (like WinRAR, 7-Zip) or directly edit the file within the archive:
     - Extract the jar: `jar xf yourapplication.jar`
     - Navigate to the extracted directory and open the `application.properties` file in a text editor.
     - Modify the database connection properties:
       ```
       spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/yourdatabasename
       spring.datasource.username=yourusername
       spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
       ```
     - Replace `yourdatabasename`, `yourusername`, and `yourpassword` with your actual database name, username, and password.
   - If you extracted and modified the properties file, repackage the jar file: `jar cf yourapplication.jar -C path/to/extracted/folder/`.

4. **Run the Application**:
   - Execute the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
     ```
     java -jar path/to/yourapplication.jar
     ```
   - Make sure to replace `path/to/yourapplication.jar` with the actual path to the jar file you downloaded.

### Troubleshooting

- **Java Not Found**: Ensure Java is installed and properly set up in your system's PATH.
- **Database Connection Issues**: Verify that your MySQL server is running and that the `application.properties` file contains the correct connection details.

## Getting Started with Next.js

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with `create-next-app`. First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Second, run the development server:
```
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
