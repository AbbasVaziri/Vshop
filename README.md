<h2>description</h2>
<p>
I built an e-commerce platform similar to Digikala.com, focusing on speed and a cool look thanks to Next.js. To make shopping easy, I used Redux and RTK for the shopping cart, so everything stays organized. I added some neat slides for showing off products with Swiper, and for all the signup and login forms, I chose Formik to keep things straightforward and Yup for making sure the info is right. Plus, I made sure everything's secure and talking smoothly to the server with Swagger, keeping user logins safe

<h2>installation</h2>
<p>To start this application, you need to have the data file of this program, which I will put in another repository.
If you've never worked with java it's possible it might be hard at first to run the back-end on localhost, but I'll try my best to fully explain how to work with it.</p>


<h3>Before running the jar file</h3>
<p>ensure you have the following installed:
 Java: You need Java 17.0.2 to run the jar file. Download and install it from <a href="https://jdk.java.net/archive/">here</a>
