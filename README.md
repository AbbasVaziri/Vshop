<p>
I built an e-commerce web-application similar to Digikala.com, focusing on speed and a cool look thanks to Next.js. To make shopping easy, I used Redux and RTK for the cart, so everything stays organized. I added some neat slides for showing off products with Swiper, and for all the signup and login forms, I chose Formik to keep things straightforward and Yup for making sure the info is right. Plus, I made sure everything's secure and talking smoothly to the server with Swagger, keeping user logins safe
